# Hermes Agent Teams

Teams run multiple agents IN PARALLEL on the same prompt.
Use a team when you want simultaneous perspectives or parallel coverage.
Use a chain when you need sequential handoff. (See hermes-chain skill.)
If you need teammates that TALK TO EACH OTHER and share a task list,
use the cc-team skill for native Claude Code teams instead.

## Invocation syntax

In Claude Code or OpenCode:
  @team:<name>  <your prompt>

Examples:
  @team:quality  verify the auth module is complete and secure
  @team:advisory  should we use Redis or Postgres for session storage?
  @team:debug  the webhook handler is dropping events intermittently

Each agent in the team receives the same prompt and responds independently.
Results come back as separate agent outputs — no synthesis step.

## All 11 Teams

### full
Agents: scout, planner, code-engineer, critic, documenter, red-team
Use when: Complete lifecycle coverage for a non-trivial feature or task.
Each agent handles their domain concurrently — recon, planning, implementation,
quality gate, docs, and security all in one shot.
Avoid for: Quick one-off tasks (too heavy). Use a chain instead.

### info
Agents: scout, documenter, critic
Use when: You need to gather, summarize, and validate information about
the codebase or a topic without making any changes.
Example: "What does the payment module do and is the documentation accurate?"

### frontend
Agents: planner, code-engineer, bowser
Use when: Frontend work where you want a plan, implementation, and
browser verification happening together.
Example: "Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page."

### experts
Agents: meta-orchestrator + all 9 domain experts
(extensions-expert, theme-expert, skills-expert, config-expert,
ui-expert, prompts-expert, agents-expert, cli-expert, keybindings-expert)
Use when: Building or extending platform components (tools, plugins,
agent definitions, themes, configs). meta-orchestrator coordinates;
experts provide specialized knowledge in parallel.
Note: Don't query domain experts directly — always go through meta-orchestrator.

### omo
Agents: oracle, librarian, scout, critic
Use when: Deep research tasks that need both internal codebase knowledge
(scout), external documentation (librarian), expert reasoning (oracle),
and a quality check (critic). Good for architecture spikes or library evaluations.
Example: "Evaluate whether to migrate from REST to tRPC for our API layer."

### advisory
Agents: oracle, metis, critic
Use when: Architecture decisions, design reviews, or approach validation
before committing to an implementation. All three are read-only — no code changes.
oracle: deep reasoning. metis: surfaces hidden complexity. critic: challenges assumptions.
Example: "Review our proposed database schema before we build migrations."

### implementation
Agents: code-engineer, prometheus, atlas
Use when: You have a clear spec and want maximum implementation throughput.
code-engineer handles incremental work, prometheus handles autonomous full-task
execution, atlas orchestrates multi-step plans. Run in parallel on different
parts of the same feature.
Example: "Implement the user auth module — split frontend and backend."

### planning
Agents: scout, planner, critic
Use when: Creating a work plan. scout maps the codebase, planner drafts the
plan, critic reviews it — all in one pass.
Example: "Create a plan for adding pagination to the posts API."

### quality
Agents: qa-tester, critic, red-team
Use when: Post-implementation verification. Run after code is written to
get test coverage, correctness verification, and security audit simultaneously.
Example: "Verify the new checkout flow is correct, tested, and secure."

### design
Agents: designer, code-engineer, critic
Use when: UI/UX work where you want design decisions, implementation,
and review in parallel.
Example: "Redesign the dashboard layout for mobile responsiveness."

### debug
Agents: debugger, scout, oracle
Use when: Something is broken and you want root-cause diagnosis (debugger),
codebase context (scout), and architectural reasoning (oracle) at the same time.
Example: "Memory usage keeps climbing after ~100 requests to the job queue."

## Choosing the right team

Situation                                  | Team
---                                        | ---
Feature needs everything top to bottom     | full
Just gathering/summarizing info            | info
Frontend work with browser verify          | frontend
Building platform components (tools, UI)  | experts
Architecture spike or library evaluation   | omo
Design decision before you commit          | advisory
Clear spec, need fast parallel build       | implementation
Need a plan before building                | planning
Code is written, need full verification    | quality
UI work with design + code + review        | design
Something is broken, need diagnosis        | debug

---

## Composing a custom team (manual parallel invocation)

Teams are fixed in teams.yaml. For a custom parallel group, invoke agents
individually in the same message, or ask atlas to coordinate them:

  @atlas  run scout, librarian, and metis in parallel on this request: [task]

Or in Hermes via delegate_task:
  delegate_task with tasks=[
    {goal: "...", context: "..."},
    {goal: "...", context: "..."},
    {goal: "...", context: "..."}
  ]
Max 3 parallel subagents via delegate_task.

---

## Adding or editing teams

Edit: /mnt/c/Users/shuff57/Documents/GitHub/agent-evo/roster/teams.yaml
Then run: bash /mnt/c/Users/shuff57/Documents/GitHub/agent-evo/sync.sh

Format:
  team-name:
    - agent-one
    - agent-two
    - agent-three

---

## Pitfalls

- Teams run in parallel — agents do NOT see each other's output. If you need
  agent A's output to feed agent B, use a chain instead.
- The "experts" team should always include meta-orchestrator as the coordinator.
  Never invoke domain experts naked — they are research-only agents.
- "full" includes red-team (6 agents total). Don't underestimate the cost.
- Teams have no built-in synthesis step. You or atlas must read and combine outputs.
- @team syntax works in Claude Code and OpenCode. Hermes itself uses delegate_task
  for parallel subagent work.
